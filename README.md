### Guide
- run `git clone https://github.com/mjkpolo/dev-env`
- run `cd dev-env`
- **you have to change the github info in the dockerfile otherwise it says I wrote everything you do**
- run `./build` and "ubuntu" is added to your bin/path
- run `ubuntu` in the folder you want to mount to docker
### Editing
type `nvim` to open the editor. use `;` in vim for a fuzzy finder, `ctrl-n` for nerdtree and `ctrl-b` for tagbar <br/>
for more, check my dotfiles and read the vimrc (which is actually linked to `.config/nvim/init.vim` in docker)
